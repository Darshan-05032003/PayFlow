# Load / stress report

All numbers from `./gradlew stressTest` on the build laptop (15 GB RAM, Gradle JVM `-Xmx2g`, test JVM `-Xmx1g`,
Robolectric SDK 35 with its native SQLite). Stress tests live in `app/src/test/.../stress` and never run in the normal suite.

## Feature: Home, transaction history (Room) and payment state model
- Scenario and scale:
  - `HistoryRoomStressTest.hundredThousandTransactionsInRoom`: 100,000 payments inserted in 100 batches of 1,000, then the
    real DAO queries the screens use: recent 5, status filter, text search, SQL summary, full list, one 50-row page.
  - `HistoryRoomStressTest.thousandConcurrentPaymentsThroughTheStateMachine`: 1,000 coroutines on `Dispatchers.IO`, each
    creating a payment and driving it CREATED → PENDING → SUCCESS (90 %) or FAILED (10 %) through the repository's
    compare-and-set.
- Results (numbers):
  - 100k insert: **550 ms** (batched). recent-5: **2 ms**. filter FAILED (16,667 rows): **93 ms**. text search over 100k:
    **55 ms**. SQL summary over 100k: **26 ms**. Full un-paged list of 100k rows: **1,807 ms**. One 50-row page: **26 ms**.
    Heap delta after everything: **11 MB**.
  - 1,000 concurrent payments (3 CAS writes each): **1,069 ms** total, 900 success / 100 failed / 0 pending, no lost update.
- What broke:
  - Nothing failed, but materialising the full 100k-row list takes ~1.8 s and would allocate 100k `Payment` objects on the
    UI path: with a 100k history the un-paged `observeHistory` Flow is the bottleneck.
- Failure flow (step by step):
  1. User with a very large history opens History with filter ALL.
  2. `observeHistory` runs `SELECT *` without LIMIT and maps every row.
  3. ~1.8 s of work on IO plus a large list diff in `LazyColumn` → visible jank, higher memory.
- Fix applied / recommendation:
  - Indices on `created_at`, `status`, `txn_ref`, `idempotency_key` are in place (filter and summary are ≤ 100 ms at 100k).
  - `PaymentDao.historyPage(limit, offset)` exists (26 ms per page); recommendation: move the History screen to Paging 3 /
    page windows if real users approach tens of thousands of transactions. The home screen only ever loads 5 rows + the SQL
    summary, so it is unaffected.
